## Week 03
Static method wii be a method performs a task that does not depend on an object. Just to perform tasks.
Call by `ClassName.Method`
if in same class, just method name.
To perform tasks:
One example is static predefined class Math = `Math.pow`






## Week 02
_import_ used to predefined methods and classes available in the Java Application Programming Interface and in other class libraries

classes are typically grouped into __packages__ so that they can be imported into programs and reused

Classes and methods help you modularize a program by separating its tasks into self-contained units.


_public_ = to be access from other areas, classes.
_private_ = variables will be only access by same class methods


methods = acess modifier + Static(or not) + Return type

Constructor = To create a object. 
If a class does not define constructors, the compiler provides a default constructor with no parameters. But if you declare, default is not created.






## Week 01
Scanner out = Display data to screen or printer

Scanner in = Get USER input from object, file, mouse , keyboard


* Class name = Capital letter in every word - Pascal casing
* variable = caMel Casing.
* Always contain only one main method       
* string in quotation marks = string literal and have null as default.
